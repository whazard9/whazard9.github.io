      <h3>Whitney's iXperience Portfiolo</h3>
      This this past summer I participated in an 8-week program called iXperience in Cape Town, South Africa. iXperience is a pre-business and technology program in which students take a course for 4 weeks and then complete an internship for 4 weeks. Students choose the area of their focus and both their course and internship will be in this area; I chose Product Management! During the course we learned about the entire product life cycle and the role of a product manager in this process. I learned how to explore a problem space, develop a vision, create use cases, conduct competitive analyses, produce wireframes, create a story map, generate a product roadmap, work with developers on an MVP, and more. I recommend you start by reading my blog post because it will tell you all about my experience during the course portion of the program. Following the course I intered at Groupon where I was the Product Manager on the production of a web-based tool. Below you will find highlights of my work from the whole program!

              Following the course I decided to write a blog post on my experience. This post is a great overview about my journey from deciding to come to iXperience to presenting my final product on the last night of the course. This post will walk you through the phases of the course and will give you an overview into my experience!

              Our team was then lucky enough to be chosen to present our idea and work to the whole program on our final night. 
              I was so nervous to speak in front of so many people, but I was also overwhelmed with pride in our product and excitement to present it to the world. This is the video of our final presentation!

              Our team created a product requirements document in order to communicate with stakeholders and developers everything they may need to know about the product. It includes our problem space, our vision, our competitors, our business plans, our go-to-market strategy, our financial projections, and incredibly detailed descriptions of the product itself.
