      <h3>Whitney's iXperience Portfiolo</h3>
      This this past summer I participated in an 8-week program called iXperience in Cape Town, South Africa. iXperience is a pre-business and technology program in which students take a course for 4 weeks and then complete an internship for 4 weeks. Students choose the area of their focus and both their course and internship will be in this area; I chose Product Management! During the course we learned about the entire product life cycle and the role of a product manager in this process. I learned how to explore a problem space, develop a vision, create use cases, conduct competitive analyses, produce wireframes, create a story map, generate a product roadmap, work with developers on an MVP, and more. I recommend you start by reading my blog post because it will tell you all about my experience during the course portion of the program. Following the course I intered at Groupon where I was the Product Manager on the production of a web-based tool. Below you will find highlights of my work from the whole program!
